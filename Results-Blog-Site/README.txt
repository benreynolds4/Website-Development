		Web design project 2014.
	Project Analysis:

	The aim of my Project is to create a blog or article style website to promote high level ameteur golf in Ireland,
	there are many utilities out there to make blogs like wordpress but i wanted to attempt to make the back-end work myself using
	php and mysql, it took me a long time to figure out how to use and implement databases so i started by loading the most recent news 
	using jquery .load() function before it became more apparent i needed to implement mysql.

	The Site is not hosted at the moment.
	
	 I've also included a file with images of each page incase you have any difficulty marking the site.
	
	The website has three main sections: mens, womens and juniors. Each section contains an articles section and a results section.

	The results section and articles section can be added to in the admin page which is password protected, the password and username is "admin", I used php to implement 
	this password protection.

	Target Audience:
		My target audience has two streams, an older audience checking on possibly the relatives results and of course the players themselve checking the results 
		of their competitions. 

	Colour Scheme:
		I initially wanted the color scheme to be completely black and white with only a very limited amount of important features in colour as i thought this kind
		of colour scheme would appeal to both the target audience and the tradition of the game but the future i went into the site the more i realised that it needed
		a greater injection of colour. I went for a predominetly black, white and green colour scheme with a lot of opacity to have a greater focus on the background.
		With the images, i tried to keep the background in black and white while having the main focus of the image in colour.
