Before the start I definitely had ambitions to do well in the tournament.”\r\nA wedge to two feet set up his opening birdie at the second and while he chipped in for another at the fourth, the majority of his birdies were the result of classy ball-striking and the kind of putting touch that smacks of a Faustian pact.\r\nHe didn’t birdie the par-five third or fifth holes and was forced to get up and down for par with a pitch and a putt at the sixth before rattling off seven birdies in his next nine holes to get to nine under.\r\nAfter sinking an 18-footer at the seventh, he hit a seven iron to 12 feet at the short ninth to turn in 32 and then birdied the 11th from two feet, tapped in for another at the par-five 12th, hit an eight iron to four feet at the par-three 13th and rolled in a 10 footer at the 14th before holing a 40 footer from just short of the 15th green for birdie number nine.\r\nHe missed a seven-footer for par after pulling his tee shot at the par-three 16th and then happily two-putted the terrifying 17th for bogey.\r\nHume was pleased to drop just one shot in his 66 before later starter Lenehan matched that score having raced to five under after eight holes in a seven-birdie round.\r\n“I’d like to get to the business end of a championship after missing the playoff by one in the Irish Amateur last year and getting to two semis in the ‘North’.” Lenehan said.'),

', 'Mourne''s Reeve Whitson has unfinished business in Sligo after adding a superb 65 to his opening 69 to top the qualifiers in the Radisson Blu-sponsored West of Ireland Amateur Open Championship at Rosses Point.\r\n\r\nThe 22-year old from Co Down had six birdies on an immaculate card to finish two strokes ahead of Portmarnock’s Geoff Lenehan on eight under 134 and clinch the silver medal.\r\nMourne''s Reeve Whitson on the 7th in the second round.

PICTURE: THOS CAFFREY / WWW.GOLFFILE.IE\r\n\r\nAfter throwing away a four up lead with five to play to lose on the 19th in last year’s semi-finals, the talented Co Down man appears determined to go all the way this year.\r\n\r\n“I am playing a whole lot better than last year, probably the best I''ve ever hit it," Whitson said. "Unfinished business? Yes, definitely.\r\n\r\n“I was four up with five to go in the semis against Niall Gorey as year and lost on the 19th.\r\n\r\n"I will never ever forget that. I am just looking forward to the matchplay and let’s see how it goes.\r\n\r\n“I played nicely again from tee to green and made a few birdies early to set up a good round. I birdied the second, and the fourth and had a gimme birdie at the ninth. \r\n\r\n"I missed a 10 inch putt for birdie at the 10th and tried not to let that affect me. Then I got a flyer and overshot the 11th and thought I might let a good round slip like yesterday.\r\nGeoff Lenehan strikes another crisp iron shot.

PICTURE: THOS CAFFREY / WWW.GOLFFILE.IE\r\n\r\n"But I made a nice birdie with two putts on the 12th to get to four under and another one at the 15th, a four iron to four feet from an awkward lie on the bank."\r\n\r\nA closing birdie from 10 feet gave him a 65 and a two round total of eight under 134 and a boost to his confidence.\r\n\r\nThe cut fell at six over par 148 — the lowest mark since 2007 — after another day of low scoring a brilliant sunshine.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, there were three albatross twos made over the first two days including two yesterday. \r\n\r\nStephen McCarthy of Black Bush had a two at the fifth in 74 on Friday but missed the cut by four shots.\r\n\r\nYesterday, Tom Gandy from the Mount Murray GC on the Isle of Man had a two at the par-five 12th in a second round 68 to qualify with ease on 138. But while Ulsterman Matt Wylie also had a two at the fifth, a 76 for 150 left him out in the cold.\r\n\r\nYet there was a lot more to the first two days of the "West" than Whitson''s consistency — he''s made just two bogeys in 36 holes — or the inordinate number of albatrosses or the fact that 17 players finished in red figures after 36 holes.\r\n\r\nLenehan has been a consistently impressive performer for some time now and this may be the week he finally turns his potential into a championship win and secures that Irish call up.\r\n\r\nDrawn in the fourth quarter, he will not see the likes of Gary McDermott, Richie O''Donovan, Dermot McElroy or Whitson unless he makes it to the final.\r\n\r\nThe bottom half of the draw is arguably weaker though Jack Hume, Harry Diamond and Gary Hurley are all in Lenehan''s firing line should he overcome Conor O’Rourke of Naas in Sunday''s first r'),

Who will win? Any of the four would be a worthy champion.  Mourne’s Reeve Whitson broke the hearts of the Connacht faithful with an impressive 5 and 3 win over local hero Steffan O’Hara to cruise into today’s semi-finals of the Radisson Blu sponsored West of Ireland Amateur Open at a sun-kissed County Sligo.  But after throwing away a big lead to lose on the 19th in the semi-finals last year, the 22-year old from Newcastle was proud of the way he focussed in front of the huge crowd and clinched a last four showdown with Irish Amateur Open champion Robbie Cannon.  “I’m just delighted to go through because this is where I got to last year, so I am looking forward to having a chance to improve on that,” said Whitson, who beat Royal Dublin’s Jeff Hopkins 3 and 1 before holing a 40 footer on the 14th to set up a comfortable win over Co Sligo favourite O’Hara.  “I felt I concent\r\n really well with all that was going on around me and I was really well focussed. I tried to keep myself in that focussed state and kept hitting good shots.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCannon, 35, beat the promising John Ross Galbraith of Whitehead by 4 and 2 in the morning before crushing Lucan’s Richard O’Donovan — who had holed an outrageous 60 footer for birdie on the 19th to beat Ballymena''s Dermot McElroy in the morning— by 5 and 4.\r\n\r\n"I was playing really well coming in here and hit the ball really well in the Rosapenna Scratch Cup had a lot of lip outs so I knew I was playing really well,"  said the Dubliner, who is a professional strength and conditioning coach.\r\n"I know where my golf ball is going and I’m in good form. I''m must happy to be here and looking forward to tomorrow. Points to prove? Not at all. I am much more mature as a golfer at this stage. I am just really enjoying my golf."\r\n\r\nWith an Irish Amateur Open and a South of Ireland title already on his CV, Cannon believes the pressure is off him as he has two Irish ‘majors’ and the other semi-finalists have yet to win a big championship on home soil.\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to lose tomorrow," said the last surviving career amateur in the field. "I have got my championships. The pressure is on the other guys tomorrow because I don''t think they have any. It will be a good match with Reeve  but I won’t worry about him, I’ll just play my own game."\r\n\r\nWhile Whitson admits that an Irish “major” would be special, he’s got the experience of winning the illustrious Spanish Amateur Open matchplay last year and he’s not getting distracted.\r\n\r\n“To win one of the Irish events would be as big as winning in Spain,” said Whitson. “I’ll just go out and play golf and see what happens. They are all tough matches.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWest Waterford''s Gary Hurley needed just 25 holes to blast his way into the last four, where he will face Naas’ Jack Hume in a repeat of their last 16 clash 12 months ago, when Hume won on the 22nd in arctic conditions.\r\n\r\nAfter crushing Portmarnock''s James Fox 7 and 5 and Galway''s Joe Lyons 8 and 6, Hurley said: “It was so cold you could hardly feel your hands. Hopefully it will be warmer tomorrow. It would be great to win a championship.”\r\n\r\nLyons, winner of the West in 2007, had high hopes of another big week when he played superbly to beat the promising Conor O’Rourke of Naas on the 18th in the morning.\r\n\r\nBut Hurley proved to be a step too far as he lost the first to a bogey, the second to a chip-in birdie and the third to an eagle three.\r\n\r\n“I three-putted five and six trying to force it and went five down and that was it,” said Lyons, glancing over at his tormentor. “He will take a bit of beating.”\r\n\r\nHume beat Dungarvan’s Kevin Stack 5 and 4 before being forced to hole clutch par putts at the 14th, 15th and 16th to see off the combative Warrenpoint man Colm Campbell 3 and 1 in the quarter-finals.\r\nColm Campbell —on his quarterfinal loss to Jack Hume\r\n“I gave him a couple of holes early on with a couple of three-putts and against players of Jack’s quality, you can’t do that,” Campbell said, adding: “I handed him 11 to go four down and then I am scratching my head.\r\n\r\n“I won 12 and 13 to get back to two and thought I had a chance but he holed a couple of clutch putts coming in, so fair play to him. As I said to him there, I hope he goes on and wins it.”\r\n\r\nWinner of all four Boys provincial titles in 2010, 20-year old Hume missed out on a play-off by a shot in last year’s Irish Amateur Open, just a week after losing a play-off for the Lytham Trophy.\r\n\r\n“You learn from those situations hopefully those experiences will stand to me tomorrow,” Hume said.\r\n\r\nHe certainly didn''t panic against Campbell though he was plainly relieved to grind out the victory.\r\n\r\n"I was four up through 11. He birdied 12 and then I three putted 13 from nowhere to go back to two up," he said. "But I was really pleased with the way I holed those putts down the last few holes to close out the match on 14, 15 and 16. It was a grind at the end but I got the win."'),
